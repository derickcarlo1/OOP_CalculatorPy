# üñ© OOP Calculator üñ©
This repository contains an object-oriented programming (OOP) calculator implemented in Python. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## How to Run üëà
### To run the calculator in your preferred IDE or Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   'git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-calculator.git'

2. Open the project in your IDE or Visual Studio Code.
3. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
4. Run the main script main.py to start the calculator.
5. Follow the prompts in the terminal to choose the operation, enter the numbers, and view the result.
6. After each calculation, you will be prompted to try again. Enter y or yes to perform another calculation, or enter n or no to exit the program.

## Why I Made This Program ü§î
I created this calculator program to demonstrate the principles of object-oriented programming in Python. By implementing the calculator using classes and objects, it becomes modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new operations in the future.

## Features ü§ñ
-Supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-Uses the operator module from Python's standard library for performing the calculations.
-Utilizes a user interface class to handle user input, display results, and error messages.
-Implements error handling for invalid input and division by zero.

## Programming Language üë®‚Äçüíª
The calculator program is implemented in Python, a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is widely used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation.
